## Running examples
- Change directory into the directory holding the example file that you're interested in running. 
- If the file is **JavaScript**, as long as you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, you can run the following command from your command line:  
`node [filename]`  
... replacing `[filename]` with the name of the file you wish to execute (for instance, `singleton.js`)
- If the file is **TypeScript**, install [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) and run the following command from your command line:  
`ts-node [filename]`  
... replacing `[filename]` with the name of the file you wish to execute (for instance, `singleton.ts`)
